			<h2>What is a Hackathon?</h2>
			<p>A hackathon is an event where people get together (usually over a weekend) to try and build a prototype to solve some problem 
defined <br /> by the event. At RHoK Ottawa, we are going to build open source software that solves hard problems facing humanity 
and humanitarians.<br /> For example, we are working with Amnesty to build a tablet app to help collect signatures.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="message">
			<h2>Do I have to be a "hacker" to participate?</h2>
			<p>Not at all! Building great software requires designers, developers and people who are familiar with the problems we are solving,<br /> but 
most importantly we need people who are passionate about solving problems.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="message">
			<h2>Do I have to have a lot of experience?</h2>
			<p>No! Hackathons are a great way to learn from people with more experience or to learn from people who have skills completely 
different <br />from your own. If you are just getting started with CSS or want to know more about web pages we want you there</p>
		</div>
		<div class="message">
			<h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
			<p>We strongly recommend that you bring a laptop, since we are building software at the event, but it's not absolutely essential</p>
		</div>
		<div class="message">
			<h2>What do you expect people to build in a weekend?</h2>
			<p>To be very clear, it’s really hard to build something complete and working in a weekend. If at the end of the weekend, 
your team only has<br /> card board prototypes of an app flow, that’s perfectly ok! The whole point of a hackathon is to get people 
with different skill sets together <br />to try and solve a problem.</p>
